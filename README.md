# BarTinder
Canâ€™t decide what to drink? Let BarTinder suggest random cocktails, complete with recipe and a video tutorial from YouTube.

A Tinder date may stand you up, but a BarTinder date can never do that. 
Sometimes drinking the same old drinks gets old, and BarTinder takes all the work out of trying something new. Browse through new cocktails by photo, select the ones you like, watch a tutorial, and enjoy.
